<h1> GHOSTS </h1>
<h2> Ghosts are pretty simple to hunt. There are many ways to identify when there is a ghost nearby, such as EMF, cold spots, and flickering lights.
EMF is a tricky thing. EMF detectors will flux in areas near power lines and many tourist attractions have machines that produce EMF so you can't always rely on EMF detctors. 
When a ghost is in the room with you, you'll know. The room will get extreemly cold and the lights will flicker. Ghosts can also possess people. If a ghost is possessing someone ectoplasm will leak from their orifices.
 The only way to get rid of a ghost is to burn the bones. And yes that does mean that you will need to dig up a body. But if the body was cremated don't panic. any left over remains such as hair or a blood stain will work.</h2>

<h1> ANGELS </h1>
<h2> Angels are really hard to kill. To kill these stiffs you would need an angel blade, these are really hard to get your hands on unless you have an angel on your side which is almost impossible.
 But there is a way to trap angels. if you can get your hands on some holy oil just make a circle of the stuff and light it on fire when the angel steps into the circle. this won't hold them long so you should get out of dodge as soon as possible. </h2>

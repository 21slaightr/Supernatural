<h2>There are a few ways that you can get rid of a demon. Exorsisms will send it back to the firey depths from where it came but there are only a few things that will kill these jerks. 
Demon blades are very rare and don't work on higher level demons. Samuel Colt's demon killing gun will also get the job done. An angel blade will also work for this. exorsisms are recommended because these other methods will not only kill the demon, they will also kill the vessel.
Identifying demons is a little harder. These jerks can possess anyone especially loved ones. One method is holy water. holy water burns their skin. Also, demons will reveal themselves when you say God's name in latin, Christo. </h2>
